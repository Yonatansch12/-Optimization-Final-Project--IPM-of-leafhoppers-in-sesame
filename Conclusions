## Conclusions
Cost Efficiency- The combined IPM treatment incurs the highest total costs compared to chemical and biological treatments. Despite its effectiveness in controlling leafhopper populations, its higher treatment costs make it less cost-efficient for growers with budget constraints. The chemical treatment shows a steady accumulation of costs, while the biological treatment has slightly higher overall costs but remains more affordable than the combined IPM treatment.
Damage Costs- The biological treatment results in the highest damage costs, indicating that while it may be less expensive in terms of treatment, it leads to more significant crop damage. The chemical treatment has moderate damage costs, making it a more balanced option. The combined IPM treatment, despite its high treatment costs, minimizes damage costs, thus protecting the crop better.
Population Control- The combined IPM treatment is the most effective at maintaining a low and consistent leafhopper population over time. The chemical and biological treatments both show fluctuations in population size, with the biological treatment experiencing the highest peaks. Therefore, for effective population control, the combined IPM treatment is superior.
Impact of Initial Population-  The initial population size significantly affects the total cost-effectiveness of each treatment. There is no single treatment that is consistently the most cost-effective across different initial population sizes. The choice of treatment should therefore consider the initial infestation level, as different treatments become more advantageous at various population sizes.
In summary, while combined IPM is the most effective in controlling leafhopper populations, its high cost may not be justifiable for all growers. Chemical treatments offer a balanced approach with moderate costs and damage, whereas biological treatments, despite lower upfront costs, may lead to higher damage and yield loss. Therefore, the choice of treatment should be guided by both economic considerations and the specific conditions of the infestation.
